============

Here is a collection of very simple example mods to get you started with writing your own mods.

Each example works similar to the other, but shows how to have mods with no settings, save game settings, and global settings.  Each example also has helper code to package up your mod into the format that is expected for mods during the build event.

To get started, download one of the example mods, open it in visual studio and click Build.  What you should end up with is a folder called Distribution with the built mod and also a zip file ready to be uploaded.
