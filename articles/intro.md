# What Can We Change?

The HK modding scene is still learning new tricks but as of right now (11/2017) here's the stuff we can do, with varying degrees of success and ease within the API.

* Change charm costs
* Change nail damage
* Change charm effects (to a certain degree)
* Change damage taken (to a certain degree)
* Change charm and item locations (randomizer)
* Change item counts (give/remove trinkets, trampass, wings, etc)
* Access and alter FSMs (Difficult and Depending on what your goal is, still not completely reliable in all situations)
* Save Data Specific to the mod inside of the save file
* Save Data specific to the mod, but not to the save file in a global settings file
* Change the behavior of dash (to a certain degree)
* Add custom text and menus on the screen (getting easier, though still not perfect, yet)
* And a bunch of stuff I'm sure I've forgotten or that we haven't yet discovered

## What can't we do easily?

* Add new areas, new enemies, new sprites for non-menu stuff
    * Alot of this is theoretically possible, but the effort involved has so far been more than anyone has tried to tackle.  Replacing charm sprites is doable, though tedious.
