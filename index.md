WORK IN PROGRESS
================

Welcome to the documentation for the Hollow Knight Modding API!
--

Like many games, modding Hollow Knight can be difficult at best because it requries editing the compiled code for the game.  While this approach works with great tools like dnspy, it also means that every new release of the game requires an entire re-implementation of your mod, by hand, again.  The Hollow Knight modding API aims to remove that barrier to entry by providing a standardized interface into many of the game's common events.  Allowing for much easier long term support of mods.

We don't make the modded API available on a public site, as part of an informal agreement with TeamCherry, but you can get it on the Hollow Knight Discord.

So where to start?  You have 2 options.  One is dead simple, the other is a little less so.

1. Join the discord and get the API release for your version.
2. Clone this repository and build the API yourself.  It's fairly straightforward, but it's also reinventing the wheel.

Once you have the API in hand, head over and check out the ExampleMod project to see some basic concepts in building mods.

You can also checkout the source of several Hollow Knight Mods which use the API today:

1. Randomizer - https://github.com/MyEyes/RandomizerMod
2. More Saves - https://github.com/KayDeeTee/hk-moresaves
3. Debug - https://github.com/seanpr96/DebugMod
4. Blackmoth - https://github.com/seanpr96/Blackmoth
5. Nightmare God Grimm - https://github.com/KayDeeTee/HK-NGG
6. Glass Soul - https://github.com/seanpr96/GlassSoulMod
7. Bonfire - https://github.com/Ayugradow/BonfireMod/
